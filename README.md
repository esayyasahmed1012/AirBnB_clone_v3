Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
Python Unit Tests
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder tests
You have to use the unittest module
All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
All your test files and folders should start by test_
Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
GitHub
There should be one project repository per group. If you clone/fork/whatever a project repository with the same name before the second deadline, you risk a 0% score.

Install Flask
$ pip3 install Flask
Tasks
0. Restart from scratch!
mandatory
No no no! We are already too far in the project to restart everything.

But once again, let’s work on a new codebase.

For this project you will fork this codebase:

Update the repository name to AirBnB_clone_v3
Update the README.md:
Add yourself as an author of the project
Add new information about your new contribution
Make it better!
If you’re the owner of this codebase, create a new repository called AirBnB_clone_v3 and copy over all files from AirBnB_clone_v2
Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3
  
1. Never fail!
mandatory


Since the beginning we’ve been using the unittest module, but do you know why unittests are so important? Because when you add a new feature, you refactor a piece of code, etc… you want to be sure you didn’t break anything.

At Holberton, we have a lot of tests, and they all pass! Just for the Intranet itself, there are:

5,213 assertions (as of 08/20/2018)
13,061 assertions (as of 01/25/2021)
The following requirements must be met for your project:

all current tests must pass (don’t delete them…)
add new tests as much as you can (tests are mandatory for some tasks)
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 | tail -1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3
   
2. Improve storage
mandatory
Update DBStorage and FileStorage, adding two new methods. All changes should be done in the branch storage_get_count:

A method to retrieve one object:

Prototype: def get(self, cls, id):
cls: class
id: string representing the object ID
Returns the object based on the class and its ID, or None if not found
A method to count the number of objects in storage:

Prototype: def count(self, cls=None):
cls: class (optional)
Returns the number of objects in storage matching the given class. If no class is passed, returns the count of all objects in storage.
Don’t forget to add new tests for these 2 methods on each storage engine.

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ cat test_get_count.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
""" Test .get() and .count() methods
"""
from models import storage
from models.state import State

print("All objects: {}".format(storage.count()))
print("State objects: {}".format(storage.count(State)))

first_state_id = list(storage.all(State).values())[0].id
print("First state: {}".format(storage.get(State, first_state_id)))

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db ./test_get_count.py 
All objects: 1013
State objects: 27
First state: [State] (f8d21261-3e79-4f5c-829a-99d7452cd73c) {'name': 'Colorado', 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 3, 25, 2, 17, 6), 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 3, 25, 2, 17, 6), '_sa_instance_state': <sqlalchemy.orm.state.InstanceState object at 0x7fc0103a8e80>, 'id': 'f8d21261-3e79-4f5c-829a-99d7452cd73c'}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ ./test_get_count.py 
All objects: 19
State objects: 5
First state: [State] (af14c85b-172f-4474-8a30-d4ec21f9795e) {'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 4, 13, 17, 10, 22, 378824), 'name': 'Arizona', 'id': 'af14c85b-172f-4474-8a30-d4ec21f9795e', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2017, 4, 13, 17, 10, 22, 378763)}

For this task, you must make a pull request on GitHub.com, and ask at least one of your peer to review and merge it.

Repo:

GitHub repository: AirBnB_clone_v3
File: models/engine/db_storage.py, models/engine/file_storage.py, tests/test_models/test_engine/test_db_storage.py, tests/test_models/test_engine/test_file_storage.py
   
3. Status of your API
mandatory
It’s time to start your API!

Your first endpoint (route) will be to return the status of your API:

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db HBNB_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 HBNB_API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
...
In another terminal:

guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status
{
  "status": "OK"
}
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ 
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ curl -X GET -s http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/v1/status -vvv 2>&1 | grep Content-Type
< Content-Type: application/json
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v3$ 
Magic right? (No need to have a pretty rendered output, it’s a JSON, only the structure is important)

Ok, let starts:

Create a folder api at the root of the project with an empty file __init__.py
Create a folder v1 inside api:
create an empty file __init__.py
create a file app.py:
create a variable app, instance of Flask
import storage from models
import app_views from api.v1.views
register the blueprint app_views to your Flask instance app
declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext that calls storage.close()
inside if __name__ == "__main__":, run your Flask server (variable app) with:
host = environment variable HBNB_API_HOST or 0.0.0.0 if not defined
port = environment variable HBNB_API_PORT or 5000 if not defined
threaded=True
Create a folder views inside v1:
create a file __init__.py:
import Blueprint from flask doc
create a variable app_views which is an instance of Blueprint (url prefix must be /api/v1)
wildcard import of everything in the package api.v1.views.index => PEP8 will complain about it, don’t worry, it’s normal and this file (v1/views/__init__.py) won’t be check.
create a file index.py
import app_views from api.v1.views
create a route /status on the object app_views that returns a JSON: "status": "OK" (see example)
